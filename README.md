# QueueSystem-by-JavaScript
The queue system is a simplified mathematical model to explain congestion. Generally, 
a queuing system occurs any time clients "request a service" from some facility; 
client arrival and service times are usually assumed to be random. 
If all of the "servers" are occupied when new clients arrive, 
those will generally wait on the next available server queue Simple queuing systems are identified by defining
 (a) the access pattern, (b) the service mechanism, and (c) the queuing system.From a probabilistic point of view, 
the properties of queues are usually derived from the properties of the associated random processes.
